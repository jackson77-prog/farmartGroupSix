## Farmart E-commerce Application
Farmart is an e-commerce application designed to revolutionize the way you buy and sell livestock.
Our mission is to bridge the gap between farmers and buyers, offering a seamless, transparent platform for purchasing animals such as horses, dogs, and camels.
By eliminating middlemen, we aim to ensure fair pricing and genuine connections. The app has been deployed at https://frontend-idkw5a8kt-jacksons-projects-3048e91a.vercel.app/ (frontend) and https://farmartgroupsix-8.onrender.com/ (backend)
